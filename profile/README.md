## Catapulta Chain Ops Suite

[Catapulta.sh](https://catapulta.sh) is a plug-n-play deployment platform which can broadcast your smart contracts deployments to 10+ networks with zero configs, automate verifications at block explorers, and share the deployment report with your team, users or clients.

Catapulta users also benefit for minimal deployment config, with one Catapulta API key you can access to multiple networks, and remove the need to handle sensitive RPC URLs, Etherscan URLs or Etherscan API keys in your Foundry or Hardhat project.
